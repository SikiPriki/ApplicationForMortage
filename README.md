# Application
This application was built with Java/Gradle. 
The program gets information from the file/prospects.txt with ReadFile.java and then Calculator.java claculates the results and prints them out. 
The program also has a very simple JUnity test. 

## Starting it

The simplest way would be to start it in any IDE which is happy with Java (example: IntelliJ). In there it will at least show EURO signs and other things that gradlew maybe doesn't like to write as they should look.

But there is also a possibility to use a Terminal. 
  - After downloading this program navigate Your way into the folder ApplicationForMortage.
  - There you can open the Terminal (or You can skip previos step and cd your way to the ApplicationForMortage folder).
  - In the Terminal write :  `./gradlew build`
  - After it has finished doing it's thing run the next command: `./gradlew run`
  - And now it should show the results.
